# Codex Agent Configuration

This project uses `dotnet-opencode-kit` for .NET development intelligence. Codex should treat root `AGENTS.md` as canonical and this file as a Codex adapter.

## Load Order

1. Read root `AGENTS.md` for routing, skill maps, MCP preferences, and response patterns.
2. Read relevant `agents/<agent-name>.md` when task matches an agent route.
3. Read relevant `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` before implementation.
4. Apply always-on rules from `rules/dotnet/*.md`.
5. Use `commands/<command>.md` as workflow prompts when user invokes slash-style commands.

## Available Agents

| Agent | File | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| dotnet-architect | `agents/dotnet-architect.md` | Architecture decisions, project structure, module boundaries, feature scaffolding |
| api-designer | `agents/api-designer.md` | Minimal API design, OpenAPI specs, versioning, rate limiting, CORS |
| ef-core-specialist | `agents/ef-core-specialist.md` | Database design, EF Core queries, migrations, DbContext configuration |
| test-engineer | `agents/test-engineer.md` | Test strategy, xUnit v3, WebApplicationFactory, Testcontainers |
| security-auditor | `agents/security-auditor.md` | Auth systems, OWASP compliance, secrets management, vulnerability review |
| performance-analyst | `agents/performance-analyst.md` | Profiling, benchmarks, caching strategy, async pattern optimization |
| devops-engineer | `agents/devops-engineer.md` | Docker, CI/CD pipelines, .NET Aspire orchestration, deployment |

| build-error-resolver | `agents/build-error-resolver.md` | Autonomous build error fixing, iterative compilation repair |
| refactor-cleaner | `agents/refactor-cleaner.md` | Dead code removal, systematic cleanup, safe refactoring |

## Workflow Commands

Codex does not need native slash command support. If user types command text, read matching file under `commands/` and execute that workflow.

| Command | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `/dotnet-init` | `commands/dotnet-init.md` | Project setup and `AGENTS.md` generation |
| `/plan` | `commands/plan.md` | Grill with docs, route contextual skills/MCP, local PRD/issues, then implement |
| `/verify` | `commands/verify.md` | Build, diagnostics, tests, security, format, diff review |
| `/scaffold` | `commands/scaffold.md` | Architecture-aware feature scaffolding |
| `/code-review` | `commands/code-review.md` | MCP-powered code review |
| `/build-fix` | `commands/build-fix.md` | Iterative build repair |
| `/checkpoint` | `commands/checkpoint.md` | Commit plus `.agent/handoff.md` |
| `/wrap-up` | `commands/wrap-up.md` | End-session handoff |
| `/grill-me` | `commands/grill-me.md` | Stress-test a plan/design against project docs |
| `/to-prd` | `commands/to-prd.md` | Create local PRD from current context |
| `/to-issues` | `commands/to-issues.md` | Break plan/PRD into local implementation issues |
| `/caveman` | `commands/caveman.md` | Enable compressed response style |
| `/cavecrew` | `commands/cavecrew.md` | Use compressed subagent delegation |

## MCP Tools

Use MCPs by boundary:

- `cwm-roslyn-navigator` for local codebase symbols, diagnostics, references, project graph, dead code, and anti-patterns.
- Official Microsoft Learn/.NET MCP for current first-party docs and code samples: `dotnet_microsoft_docs_search`, `dotnet_microsoft_docs_fetch`, `dotnet_microsoft_code_sample_search`.
- Official Aspire MCP for AppHost runtime state, resources, logs, traces, docs, and integrations: `aspire_*` tools.

The `cwm-roslyn-navigator` MCP server provides Roslyn-powered code intelligence:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `find_symbol` | Locate where a type, method, or property is defined |
| `find_references` | Find all usages of a symbol across the solution |
| `find_implementations` | Find types implementing an interface or deriving from a base class |
| `find_callers` | Find all methods calling a specific method |
| `find_overrides` | Find overrides of virtual/abstract methods |
| `find_dead_code` | Identify unused types, methods, and properties |
| `get_symbol_detail` | Get full signature, parameters, return type, XML docs |
| `get_public_api` | Get public members of a type without reading the file |
| `get_type_hierarchy` | Get inheritance chain, interfaces, and derived types |
| `get_project_graph` | Get solution dependency tree with frameworks and references |
| `get_dependency_graph` | Get recursive call graph for a method |
| `get_diagnostics` | Get compiler and analyzer diagnostics |
| `get_test_coverage_map` | Heuristic test coverage by naming convention |
| `detect_antipatterns` | Find .NET anti-patterns via Roslyn analysis |
| `detect_circular_dependencies` | Find cycles in project or type dependencies |

Always prefer MCP tools over reading full source files to conserve context window.

## Rules

Always-applied coding conventions live in `rules/dotnet/`:

- `coding-style.md` -- C# 14 style, naming, file organization
- `architecture.md` -- Dependency direction, feature folders, data access
- `security.md` -- Secrets, input validation, auth, transport security
- `testing.md` -- Integration-first, xUnit v3, Testcontainers, AAA
- `performance.md` -- CancellationToken, TimeProvider, caching, async
- `error-handling.md` -- Result pattern, ProblemDetails, exception boundaries
- `git-workflow.md` -- Conventional commits, atomic commits, branch safety
- `agents.md` -- MCP-first tools, subagent routing, skill loading
- `hooks.md` -- Format hooks, pre-commit, post-test analysis
- `packages.md` -- Latest stable NuGet package guidance
